This is Team Psych's progress on a website for Dr. Curiel.

The project is to make a new website for MSWO preference assessment. It will serve as a tool for researchers/educators to assess autistic children on their favorite “rewards” without requiring them to communicate verbally. The general premise is to present the subjects with different videos, and let them choose their favorite ones over a number of trials.
